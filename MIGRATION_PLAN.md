## Phase 1: Foundation & Core Infrastructure (Week 1-2)

### Step 1.1: Turbo Repo Setup and Configuration

**Deliverable**: Working Turbo Repo with all applications and packages
**Review Point**: All apps build successfully and communicate

**Actions**:

- Initialize Turbo Repo with proper workspace configuration
- Set up shared TypeScript and ESLint configurations
- Configure package dependencies and build optimization
- Set up development scripts and hot-reload across apps
- Configure environment variable management

**Technical Requirements**:

```json
{
  "globalDependencies": ["**/.env.*local"],
  "pipeline": {
    "build": {
      "dependsOn": ["^build"],
      "outputs": [".next/**", "!.next/cache/**", "dist/**"]
    },
    "dev": {
      "cache": false,
      "persistent": true
    }
  }
}
```

**Review Criteria**:

- [x] All packages build without errors
- [x] Hot-reload working across applications
- [x] Shared configurations properly applied
- [x] Environment variables properly managed
- [x] Turbo build optimization functional

### Step 1.2: Legacy Database Analysis and Schema Discovery

**Deliverable**: Complete analysis of existing HLStatsX database structure and data mapping requirements
**Review Point**: Legacy data structure fully documented with mapping strategy defined

**Actions**:

- **REQUEST LEGACY DATABASE ACCESS**: Obtain read-only access to existing HLStatsX MySQL database
- Analyze existing table structure, relationships, and data types
- Document all tables, columns, indexes, and foreign key relationships
- Identify data transformation requirements and potential data quality issues
- Map legacy field names to modern naming conventions
- Document any custom data or business logic embedded in the current system

**Required Information from Legacy System**:

```sql
-- Database schema export needed
SHOW CREATE DATABASE hlstatsxce;
SHOW TABLES;
DESCRIBE hlstats_Players;
DESCRIBE hlstats_Events;
DESCRIBE hlstats_Servers;
-- ... (for all major tables)

-- Sample data analysis needed
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM hlstats_Players;
SELECT * FROM hlstats_Players LIMIT 10;
SELECT DISTINCT game FROM hlstats_Players;
-- ... (sample queries to understand data patterns)
```

**Legacy Data Mapping Strategy**:

- **Player Data**: Map `hlstats_Players` → `Player` model with modern field names
- **Game Statistics**: Transform `hlstats_Events` → normalized `PlayerStats` and `GameEvents`
- **Server Information**: Convert `hlstats_Servers` → `Server` model with enhanced monitoring data
- **Weapon Statistics**: Analyze weapon-specific tables and create unified `WeaponStats` model
- **Clan/Team Data**: Map clan tables to modern `Clan` and `ClanMember` relationships

**Data Quality Assessment**:

- Identify duplicate records and data inconsistencies
- Document data validation rules from legacy system
- Analyze data volume and performance implications
- Plan for data cleanup during import process

**Review Criteria**:

- [x] Complete database schema documented
- [x] Data mapping strategy defined for all major entities
- [x] Modern schema requirements clarified based on legacy analysis

### Step 1.3: Database Design and Prisma Setup

**Deliverable**: Modern database schema with automated type generation
**Review Point**: Database schema optimized for performance and scalability

**Actions**:

- Design clean, normalized database schema based on legacy analysis
- Set up Prisma in `packages/database` with multi-app access
- Configure automated type generation for all applications
- Create seed data for development and testing
- Document schema design decisions and relationships
- Plan migration scripts based on legacy data mapping

**Modern Schema Design Principles**:

- **Consistent naming**: camelCase fields, singular table names
- **Proper relationships**: Foreign keys with cascade rules
- **Performance indexes**: Strategic indexing for common queries
- **Extensible structure**: Easy to add new game types and statistics
- **Legacy compatibility**: Import-friendly structure for data migration

**Example Schema Structure** (based on legacy analysis):

```prisma
model Player {
  id          String   @id @default(cuid())
  steamId     String   @unique
  name        String
  skill       Float    @default(1000)
  gameId      String
  game        Game     @relation(fields: [gameId], references: [id])
  statistics  PlayerStat[]
  // Legacy mapping: hlstats_Players.playerId → id, lastName → name, etc.
  legacyId    Int?     @unique // Preserve original ID for import reference
  createdAt   DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt   DateTime @updatedAt
}

model GameEvent {
  id          String   @id @default(cuid())
  playerId    String
  player      Player   @relation(fields: [playerId], references: [id])
  eventType   String
  weaponId    String?
  // Legacy mapping: hlstats_Events → GameEvent with normalized structure
  legacyEventId Int?   @unique
  timestamp   DateTime
}
```

**Review Criteria**:

- [x] Schema follows modern design principles
- [x] All relationships properly defined
- [x] Indexes optimized for common queries
- [x] TypeScript types auto-generated
- [x] Seed data creates realistic test environment
- [x] Legacy data import compatibility confirmed

### Step 1.4: GraphQL API Foundation

**Deliverable**: Working GraphQL API with basic queries and real-time capabilities
**Review Point**: API serves data efficiently with proper error handling

**Actions**:

- Set up GraphQL Yoga server in `apps/api`
- Implement basic schema for core entities (Players, Games, Servers)
- Configure Prisma Client integration
- Add subscription support for real-time updates
- Implement authentication and authorization framework

**API Design Principles**:

- **Efficient queries**: Minimize N+1 problems with proper Prisma includes
- **Type safety**: Full TypeScript integration
- **Real-time support**: GraphQL subscriptions for live updates
- **Error handling**: Consistent error responses with proper codes

**Review Criteria**:

- [x] GraphQL Playground accessible and functional
- [x] Basic queries return correct data
- [x] Error handling comprehensive
- [ ] Performance acceptable (<100ms for basic queries)

### Step 1.5: GraphQL Client Setup in Web App

**Deliverable**: A fully configured GraphQL client in `apps/web` capable of querying the `apps/api` endpoint with end-to-end type safety.
**Review Point**: The Next.js app can successfully query the GraphQL API using auto-generated, type-safe code for both Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and client-side operations.

**Actions**:

- **Install Dependencies**: Add `@apollo/client` for robust state management and caching, along with `graphql`.
- **Set Up Code Generation**:
  - Install dev dependencies: `@graphql-codegen/cli`, `@graphql-codegen/client-preset`.
  - Create a `codegen.ts` file in `apps/web` to configure the generation process.
- **Configure Codegen**:
  - Point the codegen configuration to the `apps/api` GraphQL endpoint (`http://localhost:4000/graphql`).
  - Configure it to scan `apps/web/**/*.{ts,tsx}` for GraphQL queries.
  - Use the `client-preset` to generate a fully typed client SDK.
- **Add Codegen Script**: Add a `graphql:codegen` script to `apps/web/package.json` to automate type generation.
- **Implement Apollo Client**:
  - Create a new lib file (`apps/web/src/lib/apollo-client.ts`) to initialize and export a single Apollo Client instance.
  - Implement a provider in `apps/web/src/components/apollo-provider.tsx` to wrap the application and make the client available to all components.
  - Update the root layout (`apps/web/app/layout.tsx`) to use the `ApolloProvider`.
- **Example Usage**:
  - Demonstrate a query in a Server Component using the generated SDK for SSR.
  - Demonstrate a mutation in a Client Component to showcase client-side data fetching.
- **Documentation**: Update `apps/web/README.md` with instructions on the GraphQL setup, code generation, and usage patterns.

**Technical Requirements**:

_apps/web/codegen.ts_

```typescript
import { CodegenConfig } from "@graphql-codegen/cli"

const config: CodegenConfig = {
  schema: "http://localhost:4000/graphql",
  documents: ["src/**/*.{ts,tsx}"],
  generates: {
    "./src/lib/gql/": {
      preset: "client",
      plugins: [],
    },
  },
}

export default config
```

_apps/web/package.json script_

```json
"scripts": {
  "graphql:codegen": "graphql-codegen --config codegen.ts"
}
```

**Review Criteria**:

- [ ] `pnpm graphql:codegen` runs successfully and generates typed SDK.
- [ ] Apollo Client is correctly integrated with Next.js App Router.
- [ ] Server Components can fetch data using the generated SDK during SSR.
- [ ] Client Components can perform mutations and receive updates.
- [ ] The entire data fetching pipeline is type-safe from the database to the UI.
