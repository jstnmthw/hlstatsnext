# HLStats Daemon - Migration Progress

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive plan to rewrite the legacy Perl-based HLStats daemon into a modern, scalable, and maintainable microservice using TypeScript and Node.js. It serves as the single source of truth for the migration project, detailing everything from high-level architecture to granular implementation steps.

---

## Project Goal

To replace the old HLstatsX Perl program with a robust, testable, and cloud-native solution for a modern real-time game analytics, seamlessly integrated into the existing monorepo.

---

## Core Technologies

- **Runtime**: Node.js 24+ with TypeScript 5.x
- **Database**: Prisma ORM with MySQL (utilizing the existing schema)
- **Message Queue**: Redis + BullMQ for robust event processing
- **Caching**: Redis for session management and frequently accessed data
- **Validation**: Zod for compile-time and runtime type safety
- **Testing**: Vitest for unit/integration tests, Supertest for API testing

### Service Architecture

The daemon is designed as a set of cohesive microservices, each with a distinct responsibility. This modular approach enhances scalability and maintainability.

- **Log Ingress Service**: Listens for UDP log streams from game servers, performs initial parsing, and enqueues events into Redis.
- **Event Processor Service**: The core of the application. Consumes events from the message queue, applies business logic, and updates the database.
- **RCON Service**: Provides an interface for remote server administration via the RCON protocol.
- **Statistics Service**: Aggregates and calculates real-time statistics, serving them via an API.

  - Logs every 30 seconds by default (configurable via `metricsInterval`)
  - Includes: Events Received, Events Processed, Validation Errors, Events/sec, per-queue received/processed/errors

### Phase 4 Metrics

- **Bug Fixes**: 1 critical event routing issue resolved
- **Test Coverage**: 187 tests passing (no regressions)
- **Code Quality**: Zero ESLint warnings, strict TypeScript compliance
- **Event Flow**: Clean, non-conflicting event processing pipeline

#### **Queue Priority Reclassification** ✅

  - High priority (`hlstats.events.priority`): `player.kill`, `player.suicide`, `player.teamkill`, `action.*`
  - Standard (`hlstats.events.standard`): `player.connect`, `player.disconnect`, `player.entry`, `player.change.*`, `admin.*`, `team.*`, `map.*`, `round.*`, `bomb.*`, `hostage.*`, `flag.*`, `control.*`
  - Bulk (`hlstats.events.bulk`): `weapon.*`, `stats.*`, `chat.*`
- ✅ Updated in-code topology (`queue/rabbitmq/client.ts`) and development config (`messaging/module.ts`)
- ✅ Synchronized Docker RabbitMQ `definitions.json`

### Roadmap and documentation updates

- Added `apps/daemon/docs/ROADMAP.md` with an up-to-date plan covering immediate next steps (history/activity, GeoIP, objective persistence, server load), short-/medium-term items (awards/ribbons, admin/bans, multi-game parsers, caching, distributed processing), and RC readiness criteria.

## Change Log

- 2025-08-10
  - Parser: Added support for legacy/GoldSrc-style connect lines ("entered the game") in `CsParser`.
  - Persistence: Implemented connect/disconnect logging to `events_connect` and `events_disconnect` via `PlayerRepository.createConnectEvent`/`createDisconnectEvent`; on disconnect, backfills `event_time_disconnect` on the last connect row.
  - Server Config: `ServerRepository.getServerConfig` + `ServerService.getServerConfigBoolean` added; `PlayerEventHandler` now honors per-server `IgnoreBots` to skip bot connect/disconnect lifecycle events when enabled.
  - Validation: Lint, type-check, and full test suite green.
