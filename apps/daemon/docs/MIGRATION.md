# HLStats Daemon - Migration Progress

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive plan to rewrite the legacy Perl-based HLStats daemon into a modern, scalable, and maintainable microservice using TypeScript and Node.js. It serves as the single source of truth for the migration project, detailing everything from high-level architecture to granular implementation steps.

---

## Project Goal

To replace the old HLstatsX Perl program with a robust, testable, and cloud-native solution for a modern real-time game analytics, seamlessly integrated into the existing monorepo.

---

## Core Technologies

- **Runtime**: Node.js 24+ with TypeScript 5.x
- **Database**: Prisma ORM with MySQL (utilizing the existing schema)
- **Message Queue**: Redis + BullMQ for robust event processing
- **Caching**: Redis for session management and frequently accessed data
- **Validation**: Zod for compile-time and runtime type safety
- **Testing**: Vitest for unit/integration tests, Supertest for API testing

### Service Architecture

The daemon is designed as a set of cohesive microservices, each with a distinct responsibility. This modular approach enhances scalability and maintainability.

- **Log Ingress Service**: Listens for UDP log streams from game servers, performs initial parsing, and enqueues events into Redis.
- **Event Processor Service**: The core of the application. Consumes events from the message queue, applies business logic, and updates the database.
- **RCON Service**: Provides an interface for remote server administration via the RCON protocol.
- **Statistics Service**: Aggregates and calculates real-time statistics, serving them via an API.

- **Test Coverage**: 187 tests passing (no regressions)
- **Code Quality**: Zero ESLint warnings, strict TypeScript compliance
- **Event Flow**: Clean, non-conflicting event processing pipeline

#### **Queue Priority Reclassification** ✅

  - High priority (`hlstats.events.priority`): `player.kill`, `player.suicide`, `player.teamkill`, `action.*`
  - Standard (`hlstats.events.standard`): `player.connect`, `player.disconnect`, `player.entry`, `player.change.*`, `admin.*`, `team.*`, `map.*`, `round.*`, `bomb.*`, `hostage.*`, `flag.*`, `control.*`
  - Bulk (`hlstats.events.bulk`): `weapon.*`, `stats.*`, `chat.*`
- ✅ Updated in-code topology (`queue/rabbitmq/client.ts`) and development config (`messaging/module.ts`)

## Change Log

- 2025-01-XX - **Fixed Tailwind font-size mapping and implemented simple 2px increment scale**
  - **Problem**: `text-base` class was showing 16px instead of the custom `--font-size-base` value of 14px defined in theme files.
  - **Root Cause**: Tailwind v4's default font-size utilities were not being properly overridden by the CSS variables defined in the `@theme` directive.
  - **Solution**:
    1. Added explicit utility class overrides in `@layer utilities` to ensure Tailwind's `text-*` classes use custom CSS variables
    2. Implemented simple 2px increment font scale: xs=10px, sm=12px, base=14px, lg=16px, xl=18px, etc.
    3. Updated line heights to maintain good readability ratios (1.6x for small text, scaling down to 1.24x for largest)
  - **Font Scale**:
    - `text-xs` = 10px (line-height: 16px)
    - `text-sm` = 12px (line-height: 18px)
    - `text-base` = 14px (line-height: 21px)
    - `text-lg` = 16px (line-height: 24px)
    - `text-xl` = 18px (line-height: 26px)
    - And so on in 2px increments...
  - **Files Modified**:
    - `apps/web/src/app/globals.css` - Added font-size utility overrides and implemented simple scale
    - `packages/ui/src/components/button.tsx` - Updated button sizes to use new font scale
    - **Button Size Alignment**:
    - `xs` = text-xs (10px) with standard padding (spacing.2)
    - `sm` = text-sm (12px) with standard padding (spacing.2)
    - `default` = text-base (14px) with standard padding (spacing.3)
    - `lg` = text-lg (16px) with extra X spacing (spacing.4)
    - `xl` = text-xl (18px) with extra X spacing (spacing.5)
  - **Result**: Clean, predictable font sizing with 2px increments across all components, eliminating complex percentage calculations.

- 2025-08-11
  - players_names: Added repository upsert method and wired alias aggregation across connect, change-name, disconnect (connection_time), kill (killer/victim), damage (shots/hits/headshots), teamkill (victim death). Tests added for repository and service wiring.
  - players_history: Confirmed snapshot writes via `MatchRepository.createPlayerHistory` and `MatchService.saveMatchToDatabase`; no schema change needed.
  - Quality gates: Type-check, lint green; fixed tests remain green after updating code.

- 2025-08-12
  - GeoIP seeding: Updated `packages/database/src/scripts/seed-geoip.ts` to use MaxMind download permalinks with Basic Auth (Account ID + License Key). Switched CSV download format to `.zip` and added system `unzip`-based extraction with fallback helper. Env example updated to include `MAXMIND_ACCOUNT_ID` and `MAXMIND_LICENSE_KEY`. This resolves 404s from deprecated unauthenticated URLs and aligns with MaxMind's current documentation.

- 2025-01-XX - **Dependency Cleanup: Fixed React duplication in UI package**
  - **Problem**: In `packages/ui/package.json`, React and React DOM were incorrectly listed in both `dependencies` and `peerDependencies`
  - **Root Cause**: Shared UI libraries should only have React as a `peerDependency` to avoid bundling multiple versions and potential conflicts
  - **Solution**: Removed `react` and `react-dom` from the `dependencies` section, keeping them only in `peerDependencies`
  - **Files Modified**: `packages/ui/package.json` - Cleaned up dependencies section
  - **Validation**: All monorepo packages reviewed, lint/type-check/tests pass, no other dependency misplacements found
  - **Result**: Proper dependency management across monorepo, avoiding React version conflicts in consuming applications

- 2025-08-10
  - Parser: Added support for legacy/GoldSrc-style connect lines ("entered the game") in `CsParser`.
  - Persistence: Implemented connect/disconnect logging to `events_connect` and `events_disconnect` via `PlayerRepository.createConnectEvent`/`createDisconnectEvent`; on disconnect, backfills `event_time_disconnect` on the last connect row.
  - Server Config: `ServerRepository.getServerConfig` + `ServerService.getServerConfigBoolean` added; `PlayerEventHandler` now honors per-server `IgnoreBots` to skip bot connect/disconnect lifecycle events when enabled.
  - Validation: Lint, type-check, and full test suite green.
