# HLStats Daemon v2 - Migration Progress

- [ ] Phase 1: Foundation
  - [x] Turbo structure setup (already in place)
  - [x] Core services scaffolding
  - [ ] Database schema updates (schema already available in @repo/database)
  - [x] UDP server implementation
  - [x] Unit test framework

## Completed Components

### ✅ Core Type System

- [x] Event type definitions (`src/types/common/events.types.ts`)
- [x] Base event interfaces and enums
- [x] Type-safe event processing pipeline

### ✅ Service Architecture

- [x] Gateway service skeleton (`src/services/gateway/gateway.service.ts`)
- [x] Ingress service with UDP server (`src/services/ingress/`)
  - [x] UDP server implementation with rate limiting
  - [x] Queue manager with Redis/BullMQ integration
  - [x] Base parser framework
- [x] Processor service with event handlers (`src/services/processor/`)
  - [x] Player event handler (connect/disconnect/kill)
  - [x] Weapon event handler (statistics/accuracy tracking)
  - [x] Match event handler (round/match tracking)
  - [x] Ranking event handler (ELO-style skill rating)
- [x] RCON service skeleton (`src/services/rcon/rcon.service.ts`)
- [x] Statistics service skeleton (`src/services/statistics/statistics.service.ts`)

### ✅ Testing Framework

- [x] Vitest configuration and setup
- [x] Unit tests for PlayerHandler (5 tests)
- [x] Unit tests for RankingHandler (9 tests)
- [x] Basic functionality tests
- [x] Error handling and edge case coverage
- [x] TypeScript compliance and linting

### ✅ Infrastructure

- [x] TypeScript configuration with strict mode
- [x] ESLint integration and error resolution
- [x] Package.json with all dependencies
- [x] Development scripts (dev, build, test, lint)

## Test Results

```
Test Files: 3 passed (3)
Tests: 15 passed (15)
Duration: 268ms
```

## Next Steps

- [ ] Database integration with @repo/database
- [ ] Complete ingress service parsers (CS:GO, CS2, etc.)
- [ ] Gateway service API endpoints and middleware
- [ ] RCON protocol implementation
- [ ] Statistics calculation and caching
- [ ] Integration tests
- [ ] Performance optimization
