# HLStats Daemon - Migration Progress

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive plan to rewrite the legacy Perl-based HLStats daemon into a modern, scalable, and maintainable microservice using TypeScript and Node.js. It serves as the single source of truth for the migration project, detailing everything from high-level architecture to granular implementation steps.

---

## Project Goal

To replace the old HLstatsX Perl program with a robust, testable, and cloud-native solution for a modern real-time game analytics, seamlessly integrated into the existing monorepo.

---

## Core Technologies

- **Runtime**: Node.js 24+ with TypeScript 5.x
- **Database**: Prisma ORM with MySQL (utilizing the existing schema)
- **Message Queue**: Redis + BullMQ for robust event processing
- **Caching**: Redis for session management and frequently accessed data
- **Validation**: Zod for compile-time and runtime type safety
- **Testing**: Vitest for unit/integration tests, Supertest for API testing

### Service Architecture

The daemon is designed as a set of cohesive microservices, each with a distinct responsibility. This modular approach enhances scalability and maintainability.

- **Log Ingress Service**: Listens for UDP log streams from game servers, performs initial parsing, and enqueues events into Redis.
- **Event Processor Service**: The core of the application. Consumes events from the message queue, applies business logic, and updates the database.
- **RCON Service**: Provides an interface for remote server administration via the RCON protocol.
- **Statistics Service**: Aggregates and calculates real-time statistics, serving them via an API.
